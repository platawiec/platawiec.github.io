## Home

This blog is a collection of notes on disparate topics in scientific computing, machine
learning, inverse design, optimization, and linear algebra, some with more tenuous
connections to my professional work than others.

## About

I'm a Senior Scientist at [Metalenz](http://metalenz.com/) where I lead the development of
modern software tooling for metasurface design, metrology, and fabrication. Metasurfaces are
a new class of flat optics with use in a broad range of consumer and industrial
applications.
